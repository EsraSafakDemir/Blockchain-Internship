  <p>
    We started the TUBU R&D Blockchain internship, where I applied for the online internship program, by meeting on the first day through zoom.
    In general, acquaintance and orientation were made. We talked to the interns and managers who participated in the internship process about the company and answered the
    questions asked. We recognized the platforms we will use during the internship and activated the necessary accounts.
    Expectations from the interns were stated at the end of the internship. General information about blockchain was shared. 
    A presentation was made on the free software philosophy and general information was given. 
    Blockchain base structures were mentioned. Some necessary trainings were shared when starting the internship (Javascript, Html, Cssâ€¦)
